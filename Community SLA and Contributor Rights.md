# Community SLA and Contributor Rights

This document sets a clear standard for how open source projects treat contributors.

It has two parts:

- Contributor Bill of Rights  
- Project Service Level Agreement (SLA) for community interactions  

Projects are free to adapt this, but if you claim to follow it, you should follow it in practice, not only in words.

---

## 1. Purpose and scope

This Community SLA covers how maintainers and project teams handle:

- Issues  
- Pull requests  
- Discussions and support questions  
- Code of Conduct and safety reports  
- Credit and recognition  
- Project changes that affect contributors  

It applies to all contributors, including code, docs, translations, design, triage, and community work.

---

## 2. Core principles

1. **Respect for time**  
   Contributor time is not free just because it is not on your payroll.

2. **Predictability over perfection**  
   Clear and consistent response is better than fast one day and silence the next.

3. **Transparency over silence**  
   If priorities change, say so. Do not ghost people.

4. **Safety over growth**  
   No growth goal is worth tolerating harassment or abuse.

5. **Credit over ego**  
   Contributions should be recognized in ways that are visible and meaningful.

---

## 3. Contributor Bill of Rights

Contributors to this project have the right to:

1. **Acknowledgment of their contributions**  
   - Their name listed in contributors or release notes when their work ships.  
   - Their ideas and reports treated as input, not noise.

2. **Timely response to issues and pull requests**  
   - A first human response within the time frames defined in the SLA below.  
   - A clear answer when work will not be merged or is out of scope.

3. **Clear contribution paths**  
   - Up to date docs on how to contribute, what is welcome, and what is not.  
   - Clear labels or tags that show what work is starter friendly or blocked.

4. **A safe environment**  
   - Freedom from harassment, personal attacks, and discrimination.  
   - A Code of Conduct with clear reporting channels and visible outcomes.

5. **Honest communication about project health**  
   - Notice when the project is effectively unmaintained or in low power mode.  
   - Honest expectations about how likely their work is to be reviewed or shipped.

6. **Attribution and credit**  
   - Their work not copied into other branches or products without credit.  
   - The right to be mentioned when their contributions are showcased.

7. **Exit without guilt**  
   - The freedom to step back from contributing without being shamed or pressured.  
   - No expectation of endless free labor.

## 4. Project SLA for community interactions

The numbers below are defaults. Projects can adjust them, but they should publish their actual targets.

### 4.1 Issues

**Goal:** No issue sits without a human response for more than 14 days.

- First human response: within 7 days for most issues, 3 days for security or critical bugs.  
- Initial triage decision: within 14 days. Triage means:
  - Accept as bug or feature,  
  - Mark as question,  
  - Close as out of scope with a short reason.

If the project cannot meet these timelines for a sustained period, it should:

- Mark the repo or parts of it as low maintenance or archived.  
- Update the README to set honest expectations.

### 4.2 Pull requests

**Goal:** No pull request sits without review status for more than 21 days.

- First review or status comment: within 14 days.  
- If the PR is not likely to be merged, maintainers say so clearly and early.  

Accepted patterns:

- “Thank you, this is helpful, but not something we plan to merge. Here is why.”  
- “This is a good direction, but we need X changes before we can accept it.”  

Not accepted patterns:

- Months of silence.  
- Quietly closing without a reason.  
- Commenting in a way that insults or belittles the contributor.

### 4.3 Questions and support

Projects should clearly state what level of support is realistic.

- If support is “best effort only,” say that upfront.  
- If there is a forum, chat, or mailing list, link it clearly and keep expectations honest.  

Suggested minimum:

- Acknowledgment for new questions within 7 days.  
- If the project cannot provide support, point to docs or other resources instead of ignoring people.

### 4.4 Code of Conduct and safety reports

- A named or role based contact for CoC reports, even if it is a group email.  
- A first acknowledgment of any safety report within 7 days.  
- A clear statement of whether the report is:
  - Accepted and under review,  
  - Not in scope for the project,  
  - Handed off to another body.

Outcomes that affect the community (bans, warnings) should be summarized publicly in a way that protects privacy but shows that the CoC is real.

## 5. Project responsibilities

To claim this SLA, project maintainers commit to:

1. **Publish realistic response targets**  
   - For issues, PRs, and safety reports.  
   - Update them if the team shrinks or grows.

2. **Keep contribution docs current**  
   - Explain how to propose changes.  
   - Call out areas that are stable, high risk, or unlikely to change.

3. **Label work clearly**  
   - Use labels like `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `blocked`, `out of scope`.  
   - Close or reclassify stale items rather than let them rot.

4. **Respect contributor boundaries**  
   - No pressure to volunteer for more than a person is comfortable with.  
   - No punishment for saying no.

5. **Recognize contributions**  
   - Credit in changelogs, release notes, or a CONTRIBUTORS file.  
   - Optionally, shout outs in blog posts or social channels, with consent.

6. **Communicate major changes early**  
   - Roadmap changes that will invalidate existing contributions.  
   - Plans to archive, sunset, or fork the project.

## 6. Contributor responsibilities

A healthy relationship is two way. Contributors are expected to:

1. **Follow the Code of Conduct**  
   - No harassment, personal attacks, or bad faith arguments.

2. **Respect maintainer decisions**  
   - Not every suggestion or PR will be accepted.  
   - Debate ideas, not people.

3. **Do reasonable homework before filing**  
   - Check existing issues.  
   - Read the contributing guide.  
   - Provide logs, environment, and steps to reproduce where needed.

4. **Avoid entitlement**  
   - This is not a paid support contract.  
   - Timelines are targets, not guarantees.

5. **Give clear signals**  
   - If you have to drop a PR or issue, say so.  
   - If you want to take on a task, say that too.

---

## 7. Adoption levels

To keep this honest, projects can self classify:

### Level 1: Minimum

- You adopt the Contributor Bill of Rights as written.  
- You publish your expected response times for issues and PRs.  
- You have a Code of Conduct with a visible contact method.

### Level 2: Strong

Everything in Level 1, plus:

- You actively triage issues and PRs at least once per week.  
- You publish release notes that credit contributors.  
- You post periodic updates on project health and maintenance status.

### Level 3: Gold

Everything in Strong, plus:

- You have a small contributor program or recognition path.  
- You use tags or labels to invite new contributors in a structured way.  
- You collect feedback from contributors at least once a year and act on it.

Projects should not claim a higher level than they actually meet.

## 8. How to adopt this SLA

1. Copy this file into your repo as `COMMUNITY-SLA.md`.  
2. Update the response timelines and labels to match your reality.  
3. Link to it from your `README` and `CONTRIBUTING` docs.  
4. Optional, add a short badge or note like:  
   - “This project follows the Community SLA and Contributor Rights standard.”

If you cannot meet parts of this SLA, say so directly in the document. Honesty beats pretend alignment.
