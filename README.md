# Community SLA and Contributor Rights

A no bullshit Community SLA and Contributor Bill of Rights for open source projects.

Most OSS projects run on unpaid labor. Too many treat that labor as disposable. This repo sets a clear standard for what contributors can reasonably expect, and what maintainers should commit to if they care about a healthy community.

---

## What this is

This repo contains:

- `COMMUNITY-SLA.md`  
  A practical, project agnostic Community SLA and Contributor Bill of Rights.

It is written so any open source project can:

- Adopt it as is  
- Adapt it to reality and publish their own version  
- Use it as a checklist to stop wasting contributor time

The point is not perfection. The point is clear expectations.

---

## Who this is for

- **Project maintainers** who want to treat contributors like adults, not free tech support  
- **Contributors** who are tired of silence, ghosting, and vague promises  
- **Organizations** that claim to care about community and need to prove it

If you run an OSS project and say you value contributors, this is one way to show it in writing.

## How to use this

### For maintainers

1. Copy `COMMUNITY-SLA.md` into your repo.  
2. Edit the response timelines and labels to match your actual capacity.  
3. Link it from your `README` and `CONTRIBUTING` docs.  
4. Tell contributors you follow it and then actually follow it.

If you cannot meet part of the SLA, say so directly in the file. Honest limits are better than fake promises.

### For contributors

- Use the SLA as a lens to evaluate projects you give your time to.  
- Ask projects to adopt or adapt it.  
- If a project consistently ignores the basics in this SLA, you are not obligated to stick around. Take your time and energy somewhere that respects it.

## Suggested adoption levels

If you want to publicly claim alignment, pick the level that matches reality, not your aspiration.

**Level 1: Minimum**

- You adopt the Contributor Bill of Rights as written  
- You publish response targets for issues and PRs  
- You have a Code of Conduct with a visible contact method

**Level 2: Strong**

- Everything in Minimum  
- Weekly triage of issues and PRs  
- Release notes that credit contributors  
- Periodic updates on project health and maintenance status

**Level 3: Gold**

- Everything in Strong  
- Structured contributor recognition or a lightweight program  
- Clear labels and on ramps for new contributors  
- At least yearly feedback from contributors with visible follow through

If you fall below a level, drop down or update your claim. No one benefits from pretending.
