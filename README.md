# Community SLA and Contributor Rights

This document is a straightforward Community SLA and Contributor Bill of Rights for community spaces and open source projects to adopt and follow.

Most OSS projects run on unpaid labor. Too many treat that labor as interchangeable or disposable. This document and repository set a clear standard for what contributors can reasonably expect, and what maintainers should commit to if they care about a healthy, sustainable community.

## What this is

This repository contains:

- `COMMUNITY-SLA.md`  
  A practical, project agnostic Community SLA and Contributor Bill of Rights.

It is written so any open source project can:

- Adopt it as is  
- Adapt it to fit reality and publish their own version  
- Use it as a checklist to avoid wasting contributor time

The goal is not perfection. The goal is clear expectations.

---

## Who this is for

- **Project maintainers** who want to treat contributors like partners, not free support staff  
- **Contributors** who are tired of silence, delays, and vague promises  
- **Organizations** that say they care about community and want to demonstrate that in concrete ways

If you run an OSS project and say you value contributors, this is one way to show it in writing.

## How to use this

### For maintainers

1. Copy `COMMUNITY-SLA.md` into your repository.  
2. Edit the response timelines and labels to match your actual capacity.  
3. Link it from your `README` and `CONTRIBUTING` docs.  
4. Tell contributors you follow it, then follow it.

If you cannot meet part of the SLA, state that clearly in the file. Honest limits are better than unrealistic promises.

### For contributors

- Use the SLA as a lens to evaluate projects you give your time to.  
- Ask projects to adopt or adapt it.  
- If a project consistently ignores the basics in this SLA, you are not obligated to stay. You can take your time and energy somewhere that respects it.

## Suggested adoption levels

If you want to publicly claim alignment, choose the level that reflects reality, not aspiration.

**Level 1: Minimum**

- You adopt the Contributor Bill of Rights as written  
- You publish response targets for issues and PRs  
- You have a Code of Conduct with a visible contact method

**Level 2: Strong**

- Everything in Minimum  
- Weekly triage of issues and PRs  
- Release notes that credit contributors  
- Periodic updates on project health and maintenance status

**Level 3: Gold**

- Everything in Strong  
- Structured contributor recognition or a lightweight program  
- Clear labels and on ramps for new contributors  
- At least yearly feedback from contributors with visible follow through

If you fall below a level, adjust your stated level or update your claim. Accuracy builds trust.

## Contributing to this standard

This is version 1. It should improve with real input and real use.

You can contribute by:

- Opening issues with concrete problems or edge cases  
- Proposing wording changes that keep it clear, direct, and practical  
- Sharing how you adopted or adapted it in your project

Keep pull requests focused and useful. Avoid jargon, marketing language, and manifesto-style bloat.
